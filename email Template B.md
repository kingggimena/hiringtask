Hi Joy, 

We have noticed that you haven't filled up the group survey yet.

As you know, grouping the students according to their background, interests, and experience level is quite important to us. We believe this is essential in establishing productive, friendly, and collaborative sessions.  

Please complete the survey as soon as possible. This way we can find the best group for you, and you won't fall behind. 

All the best, 



CodePath.org Team
