Hello King, 

We are very happy to learn of your interest in becoming a TA in one of our classes! Before we go to the next step, please allow us to give you some information about the exciting job waiting for you. 

We currently offer three different [courses](https://codepath.org/classes) namely Cybersecurity and Hacking, iOS for CS majors, and Android for CS majors. These courses run for 12 weeks and are divided into two sessions a week. As a TA in one of our courses, you must commit 2 hours a week while the course is running. Please let us know if you would be available on either one of these schedules: 
- Thursdays 6-8 pm PT
- Saturdays 4-6 pm PT 

Aside from being a TA, there are also other ways to contribute to our community. You can learn more about this [here](https://codepath.org/volunteer).

If you are ready to **move forward with your application**, please fill-up this [form](https://forms.gle/2PHQtD1QREqA6kX76).

We are looking forward to having you as part of the CodePath.org community! If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to us through contactus@codepath.org. 

All the best, 



CodePath.org Team
