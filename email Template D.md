Hello Jessica, 

Thank you for signing up for our  [Interview Prep course](https://codepath.org/classes/interviewprep). This is not a rejection notice, but unfortunately, all slots are taken and admissions are now closed. 

However, as this course is regularly offered in summer, we encourage you to reapply for Summer 2021. To receive updates on next year's admissions and future course offerings, you may sign up for our mailing list [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe_LUv5uxuKe7oo1Pw4KyS013mNwF6Q0_T5jMm0nSze5rVEvg/viewform). For more helpful information, please visit this [page](https://codepath.org/career). 

In the meantime, it might be good to gear up for your future technical interviews. Please go over the high-level software [interview guide](https://hackmd.io/@nesquena/HJN9k17sm?type=view) that our team has developed to help our students ace their internship interviews. 

Again, we thank you for your interest in joining the CodePath.org community, and we hope to see your application in the near future. 

All the best, 

CodePath.org Team
